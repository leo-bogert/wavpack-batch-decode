wavpack-batch-decode
====================

A bash script to batch-decode many WavPacks. Will extract CUE and LOG as well.

WARNING: I needed this for one-time use. Therefore, it is not well-tested and should be considered as dangerous to use. Please only use it if you understand bash and are able to review it first.
